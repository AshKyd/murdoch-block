# Adblock Murdoch list
[News Corpâ€™s partisan campaign coverage is harmful to democracy](https://theconversation.com/new-low-for-journalism-why-news-corps-partisan-campaign-coverage-is-harmful-to-democracy-116796). Thus, this collection of URLs and blocklists for News Limited websites.

# Contributing
Please feel free to contribute any links as a pull request or by creating a new issue.

New links should include:
1. The URL in question
2. Proof that this is a News Limited publication.

This repo does not aim to tackle fake news as a whole, only that from News Limited/Rupert Murdoch publications.

# TODO
Eventually I'm going to write a script to convert these into various blocklists 
for adblock & hosts file, but I've messed up my back and I'm in a fair amount of
pain so I just want to push it and see what happens in the meantime.
